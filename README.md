# InfoGami **( Name not yet finalized :P)**
-------------------------------------

An online Social Network for a college made for the developers, coders, electronic freaks etc.


During the starting years in the college , a student has no idea about college, students around him, people of his/her interest, their social accounts, contact with seniors and alumnis etc.
So bringing all these things together makes InfoGami.

You can :

  + Ask questions related to college, coding, developing etc. ( sorted according to the fields).
  + Meet people of your interest and skills.
  + Get the skill statistics of a person and the entire college.
  + Search on the basis of interests and skills.
  + Create groups in college for meetups.
  + Create events, meetups or talks.
  + Suggest an event to take user views and votes for that particular event.
  + Work collaboratively : Find and host projects of your interest in college.
  + Write blog
  + The Info : A search engine which gives best results.

Technologies Used :

  + Python
  + Django
  + HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
  + D3.js
  + and a lot more stuff :P

Will be started in NIT Kurukshetra.
